Implement the find_all_hobbyists function that takes a hobby,
and an object consisting of people's names mapped to their respective hobbies.
The function should return a List containing the names of the people (in any order)
that enjoy the hobby.

For example, the following code should display the name 'Chad'.

hobbies = {
    "Steve": ["Fashion", "Piano", "Reading"],
    "Patty": ["Drama", "Magic", "Yoga"],
    "Chad": ["Puzzles", "Pets", "Yoga"]
}

print(find_all_hobbyists("Yoga", hobbies))
