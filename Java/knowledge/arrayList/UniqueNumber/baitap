roblem: Write a method that efficiently finds all numbers that occur exactly once in an input list.

For example:

Input: numbers = [1, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [2, 3]
Requirements:

The method should return a list of numbers that appear exactly once in the input list.
The implementation must be efficient with respect to time complexity.
You can assume the input is an array of integers.
